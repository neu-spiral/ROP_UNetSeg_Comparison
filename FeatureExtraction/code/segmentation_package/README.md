## Segmentation Module
We used [Oribix retina-unet](https://github.com/orobix/retina-unet.git) package in our code package provided here. 
However, the results provided in 'From Color Image to Severity Score' paper are based on the segmentation module by [Brown et. al.](https://doi.org/10.1117/12.2295942)  

For details about the segmentation modules please have a look at the following links.
